# Hi there, I'm thelastbucuc! 👋

I am a passionate Game Developer dedicated to mastering Godot 4. I've recently completed a structured journey of building **8 diverse games**, each focusing on different technical challenges from AI pathfinding to data-driven level design.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Engine:** Godot 4.5 (GDScript)
* **Concepts:** OOP, Signal-driven Architecture, Factory Patterns, Pathfinding (Navigation2D).
* **Tools:** Git, GitHub Desktop, JSON.
